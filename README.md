In recent years there has been a growing awareness of mental health issues worldwide. Despite this increased awareness, a significant treatment gap persists, with many individuals not seeking or receiving the treatment they need. This is especially true in the technology industry, which is known for its pressure to product innovation, fast pace, and relentless pursuit of progress. The tech industry presents a unique landscape for examining mental health seeking behavior within its workforce. Understanding the factors that promote an increased likelihood of employees seeking mental health treatment can ensure the wellbeing of employees and the continued business success of employers.

This analysis examines a range of factors that contribute to the mental health seeking behavior among tech workers, such as:

- Stigma: prevailing attitudes towards mental health within tech companies and how they affect employees willingness to seek treatment. Promoting mental health support-seeking behaviors would include addressing stigmas within the workplace.
- Family History: Assessing the impact of familial mental health history on individuals' willingness to seek treatment.
- Experience with Mental Health Conditions: Investigating whether personal experiences with mental health conditions affect one's propensity to seek support and the perceived interference of these conditions with work responsibilities.
- Awareness of Available Mental Health Care Options: Examining the extent to which tech workers are informed about the mental health care options provided by their employers and how this awareness influences seeking treatment.

Overall, the analysis found that:

- Employees tend to seek mental health despite their employment status.
- An employee will seek mental health treatment regardless of whether they believe that seeking treatment will have a negative consequence on their career.
- Employees are more likely to seek mental health treatment even if they feel their mental health condition impacts their work performance only marginally
- Family history plays a significant role in shaping individualsâ€™ behaviors towards mental health treatment seeking. Individuals with family history are more proactive in seeking professional help. 
- Employees that fully understand their care options are more likely to seek mental health treatment.
- Employees that have access to resources that help identify and provide treatment methods for mental health issues are more likely to seek mental health treatment.
- Employers that offer mental health benefits will see their employees seek mental health treatment at a significantly higher rate.

In conclusion, the findings suggest that offering mental health benefits could positively influence employees to seek treatment, as understanding these benefits may alleviate concerns and encourage individuals to prioritize their mental well-being. It stands to reason that promoting and employing a mentally healthy workforce would lead to better business outcomes, as employees would (seemingly) perform better with a stable mental foundation. A follow up to this analysis would have an employer implement (or continue to promote) mental well being and measure the effectiveness of these programs against business performance/ outcomes to determine, statistically, if more mentally healthy employees produce better business results.
